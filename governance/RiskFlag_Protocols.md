## 🛑 Purpose

To define transparent, explainable, and justifiable flagging protocols for AI-detected border risks—including individuals, goods, vehicles, and digital agents.

## 🧠 AI Risk Flagging Layers

1. **Layer 1: Identity Irregularity**
- Passport duplication
- Inconsistent biometrics
- Suspicious voiceprints (via ZTV)

2. **Layer 2: Behavior Anomaly**
- Travel pattern irregularity
- Heatmap signature mismatch
- Bypassing standard routing points

3. **Layer 3: Cargo Integrity Risk**
- Non-matching manifest
- Detected temperature anomalies
- Unauthorized electronic emissions

4. **Layer 4: Geo-Political Sensitivity**
- High-alert region traversal
- Blacklisted affiliations or flagged signals
- AI-manipulated identity reconstruction

---

## 🔍 Human Review Triggers

- Automatic escalation if more than **2 layers** are flagged
- Manual override authority for verified Human Border Auditors
- Justification logs are required for every hold or detainment

---

## 📦 Data Handling Notes

- Risk flags are **temporary indicators**, not verdicts
- Must be reviewed within 24h or automatically expire
- All flags must be stored with explanation and timestamp
