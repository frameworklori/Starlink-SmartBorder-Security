## 🧭 Purpose

To establish a clear ethical boundary for the application of AI in border control, surveillance, and migration systems. These guidelines are intended to prevent abuse, uphold dignity, and ensure consent-based, transparent enforcement.

## ⚖️ Key Ethical Principles

1. **Informed Consent**
No biometric, voice, or behavioral data may be collected without full disclosure and consent where applicable.

2. **AI-Override Safeguards**
AI must always be subject to human override, especially in life-impacting decisions such as asylum denial or detainment.

3. **Bias & Discrimination Filters**
AI systems must be tested for racial, linguistic, and geopolitical biases before deployment.

4. **Non-Weaponization Clause**
AI must not be deployed to automate physical harm, lethal force, or psychological manipulation at borders.

5. **Time-Bound Data Retention**
All border-related AI logs must have expiry protocols and cannot be stored indefinitely.
