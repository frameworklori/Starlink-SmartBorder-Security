## 📘 Overview

This Policy Charter defines the foundational governance principles, decision-making protocols, and accountability structures for the **Starlink-SmartBorder-Security** system. It serves as the guiding document for all related modules, from risk flagging to operational ethics, ensuring lawful, transparent, and human-centric border AI operations.

## 🧭 1. Guiding Principles

- **Human Sovereignty First**: All AI actions must prioritize the dignity, rights, and safety of individuals.
- **Transparency by Design**: Decision paths, alert triggers, and data logging must be traceable and accessible to oversight authorities.
- **Zero Trust until Verified**: Default posture is skeptical; verification layers (voiceprint, biometrics, credential match) are required.
- **No Weaponization Clause**: The system shall not be repurposed for crowd control, surveillance of civilians, or military proxy.
