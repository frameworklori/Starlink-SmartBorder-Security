# 🛡️ Governance Modules – Starlink-SmartBorder-Security

This folder contains the governance logic, policy protocols, ethical safeguards, and oversight mechanisms necessary to ensure lawful and resilient deployment of the Starlink-SmartBorder-Security infrastructure.

## 📌 Purpose

To provide a modular, transparent, and human-centric governance architecture that can be audited, updated, and adapted across jurisdictions. This includes:

- Legal frameworks for border deployment
- Community inclusion protocols
- International coordination interfaces
- Ethical AI/robotic usage policies
- Disaster contingency governance plans

## 📂 Submodules (Planned / Referenced)

- `Policy_Charter.md` – Core policy doctrine and legal framing
- `Emergency_Oversight.md` – Governance procedures during high-risk incidents (e.g., border breach, cyberattacks)
- `AI_Ethics_Protocol.md` – Limits and obligations of automated systems in sensitive zones
- `Civilian_SafeZones_Guide.md` – Protection protocols for refugee or innocent civilian proximity

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Redacted sections may apply for sensitive use cases (military, classified nodes).
- Module licensing will follow `LORI Private Semantic Governance License v1.0`.

## 🔁 Interoperability

This governance layer is designed to interlock with the following repo folders:

- `ops/` – Real-time runbooks
- `scripts/tools/` – Policy-triggered automation
- `docs/ethics/` – Ethical justification papers
- `hardware/` – Device-level compliance logic
