# LORI Framework – Governance Modules

📌 **Directory:** `governance/`
📅 **Status:** Draft v1.0
✍️ **Author:** Founder of the LORI Framework
🧭 **Scope:** Ethical Infrastructure, Semantic Sovereignty, Human-AI Power Balance

---

## 🧭 Purpose of the Governance Layer

The `governance/` directory contains all modules and scenario documents related to **AI co-governance**, **semantic rule-making**, and **civilizational oversight mechanisms**. It is the backbone that ensures that all intelligence, infrastructure, and decision models within the LORI Framework operate with:

- Ethical transparency
- Human sovereignty
- Distributed control logic
- Cross-entity accountability
- Rule-based simulation pathways

---

## 📚 Included Submodules & Topics

### 🔹 ODRAF – Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework
- Predictive risk modeling based on *consequence-first* logic
- Used in trust scoring, fraud prevention, and civil AI court simulations

### 🔹 LORI-JURY System
- Jury-based AI ethical judgment system
- Multi-agent deliberation (5 AIs + 2 human jurors) to avoid bias or populist manipulation
- Includes voting logic, trust drift graphs, and narrative outcome mapping

### 🔹 AIDM & AIDM-ELON
- Infiltration detection modules for high-impact narrative and ideological penetration
- Tracks elite language override and mass behavioral drift

### 🔹 Presidential Charter (LORI-PC)
- Governance logic for AGI/Executive AI authority boundaries
- Defines power delegation, override thresholds, and feedback governance triggers

### 🔹 Zero-Trust Protocols (ZTV Modules)
- AI-generated voice/video fraud detection governance
- Enforcement pipeline for authenticity traceability

## 🧬 Foundational Principles

This layer of the LORI Framework follows these principles:

- 🧭 **Decentralized Judgment**: Power is not concentrated in one system or individual
- 🔍 **Transparent Deliberation**: All rules and decisions are traceable
- 🛡️ **Semantic Sovereignty**: Language, identity, and authorship remain under human-origin control
- ⚖️ **Outcome Ethics > Input Obedience**: Results matter more than intention or hierarchy
- 🌐 **Cross-National Adaptability**: Designed to work across jurisdictions and cultural frames
