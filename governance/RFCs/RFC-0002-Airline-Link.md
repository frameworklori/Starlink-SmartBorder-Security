# RFC-0002: Airline Incident Integration via API

## Problem
Border holds triggered by AI need airline-level delay protocol integration.

## Proposal
Standardize a `Carrier_API_Spec` for gate-hold decisions, linking:
- DHS/CBP Flag Systems
- SmartBorder Escalation Tier
- Red_Flag_Queue integrity check

## Expected Benefit
- Prevent mid-flight detentions
- Integrate with biometric boarding systems
