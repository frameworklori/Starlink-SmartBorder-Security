# University Risk Gateway Architecture

Focused on protecting sensitive U.S. research from covert exfiltration via academic departure.

---

## Target Use Case:
- Foreign graduate students returning with AI/Quantum/IP risks
- Cross-check with research risk index

## Workflow:
1. SmartBorder exit ping
2. Device anomaly detected
3. Match against University Watchlist (non-PII)
4. Escalate if triple flag matched (field × device × timing)

## Ethics Control:
- No research field profiling by nationality
- Must be DHS-verified + human-reviewed
