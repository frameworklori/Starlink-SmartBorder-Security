# Risk Balance – Security vs. Liberty
© LORI Framework

---

## Principle:
SmartBorder security must balance **threat response** with **protection of individual rights** and **academic freedom**.

---

## Threat Types:
- AGI code theft
- Border terrorist transit
- Economic exfiltration of university research

---

## Liberty Protections:
- Sunset clauses on all sensors
- All red flags require **2-stage human review**
- Oversight by Civil Liberties Panel

---

## Bottom Line:
Security without liberty risks autocracy. Liberty without enforcement risks exploitation. We aim to model both.
