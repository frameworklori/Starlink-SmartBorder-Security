# Positioning Statement
© LORI Framework | Starlink-SmartBorder-Security

---

## Intent:
This project serves as a **technical horizon scan** — an objective preview of potential architectures, ethical hazards, and legal considerations of next-gen border security.

---

## What it is:
- A modular tech blueprint
- Civil-liberties sensitive
- Privacy-conscious by design
- Grounded in U.S. constitutional compliance

---

## What it is NOT:
- A surveillance system in production
- A final policy proposal
- A replacement for legal process or political consensus

---

## Responsibility:
Final implementation decisions lie solely with the democratically elected government of the United States.
