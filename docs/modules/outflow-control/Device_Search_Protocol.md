## Context:
This outlines the procedures for inspecting digital devices at border checkpoints without violating constitutional protections.

---

## Legal Trigger:
- Based on **“border search exception”** (U.S. Customs & Border Protection, CBP)
- Supported by 2018 Supreme Court references (Riley v. California limitations considered)

---

## Protocol Flow:
1. **Pre-flag check**: Only flagged individuals/devices are eligible for inspection
2. **Consent-first attempt**: Request access PIN or biometric
3. **Refusal → Seizure Path**: Escalate to CBP Form 6051D
4. **Maximum hold time**: 5 days (or 15 with warrant)

## Notes:
- No cloud accounts accessed without consent
- No forced biometric unlock
- Remote wipe protection is logged
