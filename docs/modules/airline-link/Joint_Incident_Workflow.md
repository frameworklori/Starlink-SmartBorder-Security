# Joint Incident Workflow – TSA / CBP / Carrier / SmartBorder
© LORI Framework | airline-link/Joint_Incident_Workflow.md

This document outlines the joint protocol for managing flagged passengers prior to boarding.

---

## Trigger:
- Passenger manifest triggers SmartBorder AI risk score > 0.82
- Cross-check with CBP "Secondary Inspection Watchlist"

---

## Roles:

| Actor | Responsibility |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| TSA Agent | Initial boarding denial + report filing |
| CBP Officer | Identity match + entry/exit record sync |
| Carrier Rep | Communicates delay & rights info |
| DHS Liaison | Final escalation or override approval |

---

## Escalation Flow:
1. Carrier receives RED flag → sends delay hold signal to gate
2. TSA confirms visual ID and SmartBorder hit
3. CBP links incident to border record (if any)
4. DHS approves boarding denial + initiates clearance protocol

---

## Response Window:
- Must be resolved within **45 minutes** or auto-clear for GREEN
