# Gait Recognition Module
© LORI Framework | bio-scan/Gait_Recognition.md

---

## Objective:
To identify or classify individuals based on their natural walking pattern without the need for facial or fingerprint data.

---

## Method:
- Step length consistency
- Hip sway and bounce rhythm
- Shoulder-to-foot axis swing
- Temporal cadence analysis

## Technical Stack:
- 3D pose estimation using stereo IR or UWB
- LSTM gait-sequence classification
- Comparison to known behavioral pattern clusters

## Ethics:
- No permanent biometric signature retained
- Reset gait cache every 3 minutes if not escalated
