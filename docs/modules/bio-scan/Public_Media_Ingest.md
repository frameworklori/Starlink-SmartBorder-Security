## Purpose:
Allows system to reference or confirm risk signals based on **publicly available media** (e.g., livestreams, border cams, news footage), without surveillance tagging or person tracking.

---

## Workflow:
1. Open-source video scanned via local AI node
2. No persistent ID match; only anomaly detection
3. Signals crosschecked against live edge alerts

## Scenario:
- Livestream shows suspicious motion → matched with thermal spike → low-confidence alert pushed to analyst

## Ethical Guardrails:
- No social media profiling
- No user-facing accounts scraped
- Only public-facing unencrypted streams permitted
