# Bio-Scan Modules – Starlink-SmartBorder-Security
© LORI Framework | Internal Sensor Blueprint

This folder documents the biometric and physiological sensing modules used by the SmartBorder edge nodes. All modules are designed for passive, non-invasive operation and are bound by democratic oversight.

## Modules Included:
- `Gait_Recognition.md`
- `Heartbeat_Radar.md`
- `Voiceprint_System.md`
- `Thermal_IR.md`
- `Public_Media_Ingest.md`

Each sensor module is deployed only when above-threshold motion or risk indicators are detected. No persistent biometric logging occurs unless escalated.
