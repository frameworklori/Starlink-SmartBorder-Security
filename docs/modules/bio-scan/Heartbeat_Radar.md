---

## Purpose:
To detect concealed motionless individuals using micro-vibrational radar reflections associated with breathing and heartbeat.

---

## Technology:
- UWB impulse radar
- Doppler phase shift return analysis
- Micro-respiration resonance mapping

## Use Cases:
- Detection of individuals hidden in cargo, vehicles, or behind walls
- Nighttime checkpoint passive scanning

## Privacy Considerations:
- Not deployed unless stationary anomaly is detected by thermal + visual
- No data stored unless pattern matches lifeform threshold
