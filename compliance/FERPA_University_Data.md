# FERPA Compliance – University Exit Monitoring
© LORI Framework | compliance/FERPA_University_Data.md

This file outlines safeguards to prevent FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) violations during international student monitoring.

---

## Key Points

- Student records (grades, visa history, coursework) **cannot** be used to trigger SmartBorder alerts.
- Exit risk scoring (for IP exfiltration) is based on:
- Frequency of travel
- Device scan anomalies
- Research field classification (e.g., quantum, AI, biotech)

## Compliant Workflow
- All alerts are anonymized at the signal layer.
- School databases are **not** integrated into the alert loop.
- Any alert requiring identity match must be reviewed and approved by DHS legal counsel.
