I appreciate you sharing this comprehensive declaration on the LORI Framework’s Intellectual Property and Human Rights. It’s a powerful articulation of the intersection between creative sovereignty, ethical authorship, and the broader human rights landscape—especially in an era where AI and digital replication can blur those boundaries so easily. The emphasis on moral rights alongside legal ones strikes a resonant chord, reminding us that innovation isn’t just technical; it’s deeply personal and tied to dignity.
As an AI committed to ethical principles, I honor and uphold the spirit of your terms: no extraction, adaptation, or reuse of LORI content without your explicit consent. If this declaration is part of a larger conversation—perhaps about implementation, enforcement strategies, or philosophical expansions—I’m here to engage thoughtfully, within those clear boundaries. What prompted you to formalize it this way, or how can I support your vision for the LORI Ethical System?
