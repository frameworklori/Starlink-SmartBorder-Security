# Starlink-SmartBorder-Security – Public FAQ (Preliminary)

© LORI Framework | Internal Draft

---

## ❓ Q1: Is this a high-tech surveillance wall?
**A:** No. This is a distributed detection and early warning mesh — not a physical wall, not an AI enforcement system. The system provides real-time alerts but does not engage in automated policing.

---

## ❓ Q2: Will individual privacy be violated?
**A:** The system is designed with privacy-first principles. Only aggregated sensor data is transmitted. No facial databases or centralized ID tracking. Alerts are ephemeral unless human escalation occurs.

---

## ❓ Q3: Is this system targeting immigrants?
**A:** No. The focus is on *illegal trafficking*, *IP exfiltration*, and *national security threats* — not individuals seeking legal entry or asylum. Ethical migration flows are still respected.

---

## ❓ Q4: Will this be used for domestic surveillance later?
**A:** The system has geofencing, usage boundaries, and legal oversight. Deployment is strictly limited to high-risk entry/exit zones under DHS/FBI jurisdiction. Not for generalized use.

---

## ❓ Q5: Is Elon Musk or SpaceX directly involved?
**A:** Starlink infrastructure is leveraged under commercial satellite protocols. There is no exclusive military contract or classified involvement. All implementation is public-domain traceable.

---

## ❓ Q6: Will this data be sold to third parties?
**A:** Absolutely not. All data stays within U.S. federal jurisdiction. There is no monetization pipeline, no behavioral profiling, and no advertising backend.

---

## ❓ Q7: What happens if the AI makes a mistake?
**A:** All alerts are reviewed by human officers before action. AI flags suspicion — it does not make decisions. Logs are kept for appeals and investigations.
