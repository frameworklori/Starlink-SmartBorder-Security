# Community Input Process

To ensure that this module is aligned with human rights, local sovereignty, and ethical standards, we propose the following civic-input loop:

- 🗣️ Community Forum: Border-area residents, NGOs, and humanitarian observers participate in periodic reviews.
- 📥 Feedback Window: Structured submissions (monthly) reviewed by a joint ethical advisory board.
- 🔁 Feedback-to-Model Loop: Algorithm thresholds and detection biases are retrained where concerns arise.
- 🧾 Transparency Log: Published summaries of changes per feedback.

*This is a non-tokenized, non-voting loop — it is designed for traceable narrative influence, not governance capture.*
