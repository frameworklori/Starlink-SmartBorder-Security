# Ethical Principles

1. **Human-Centric AI** – Surveillance systems must never override the sanctity of life.
2. **Transparency by Design** – All detection triggers are explainable, inspectable, and semantically versioned.
3. **Border ≠ Threat Line** – The system distinguishes between threat detection and humanitarian flows.
4. **No Face Recognition** – This module intentionally excludes facial detection to avoid biometric misuse.
5. **Auditability First** – Any action taken must be traceable to a non-retroactive decision logic record.
