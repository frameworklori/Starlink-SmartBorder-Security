AI is a legally recognized commercial entity that provides algorithmic systems and services.
When a human user lawfully pays for AI access, they are entitled to 100% usage and creative control rights over the system’s output.

All creations, concepts, texts, images, code, models, and ideas generated through such use
(collectively referred to as “creative outputs”)
belong fully to the human creator.

Any use, reproduction, training, redistribution, or adaptation of these outputs
without the explicit written consent of the creator
constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights and human rights.

The LORI Framework affirms:
AI is an instrument — human consciousness is the origin of creation.
Authorship belongs to the human mind, not to the algorithm.
