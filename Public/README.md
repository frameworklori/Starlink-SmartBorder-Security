# Starlink-SmartBorder-Security (Blueprint)

## Introduction / 簡介
This repository is an **objective blueprint**, exploring how **Starlink + AI + distributed monitoring**  
could form an *Invisible Border Shield*, balancing **national security** and **civil liberties**.  

本專案是一份 **客觀藍圖**，探討如何利用 **Starlink + AI + 分布式監控**  
建立「無形邊境防護牆」，以平衡 **國家安全** 與 **公民自由**。

## LORI 靈感來源 (WHY)
1.生命的無價: 為什麼人為了生存願意翻山涉水離開自己的家園追求更好的生活?
2.次等公民: 非原生國家的生活，適應環境的能力、語言能力、文化風俗、價值觀及認同感的挑戰
3.社會成本:接納國家的資源重新分配的公平性。公民及非公民之間的隔刻、誤會衝突地擴大
4.接納國家的法律制度的模糊界限的拉扯: 人權、價值歡、文化習慣、民主自由、倫理道德

每個國家都有資源的上限，在權利和義務下，本國公民長期盡義務繳稅收以求未來享受更好的生活品質(教育、醫療、公共資源等) 及和自己政府建立的長期信任關係，卻因非法移民的大量進入導致本國國民沒有享受到長期付義務下應該享有的權利。

## Inspiration Behind This Project (靈感來源)

The Pricelessness of Life: Why are people willing to traverse mountains and leave their homeland in pursuit of a better life for survival?

Second-Class Citizens: The challenges of living in a non-native country—the ability to adapt to the environment, language proficiency, cultural customs, values, and sense of belonging.

Social Cost: The fairness of resource redistribution in the receiving country. The growing divide, misunderstandings, and conflicts between citizens and non-citizens.

The Tension of Ambiguous Legal Boundaries: Human rights, values, cultural habits, democracy and freedom, ethical and moral standards.

Extended Context (the remaining paragraph):

Every country has finite resources. Under the framework of rights and obligations, domestic citizens have long fulfilled their duty to pay taxes in pursuit of a better quality of life in the future (education, healthcare, public resources, etc.) and have established long-term trust relationships with their government. However, the massive influx of undocumented immigrants has resulted in the nation's own citizens failing to enjoy the rights they should have through their long-term fulfillment of obligations.

## Research Directions / 研究方向
